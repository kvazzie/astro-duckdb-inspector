# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments with `jq` and fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

The `gh` CLI infers the repository from `git remote -v`.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** Set this to `yes` if the repo later treats external pull requests as feature requests.

When set to `yes`, PRs use the same labels and states as issues:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, then retain `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, and `NONE`.
- **Comment, label, or close**: use `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit`, and `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve a bare issue number with `gh pr view <number>` and fall back to `gh issue view <number>`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

The `/wayfinder` skill uses one issue as a map and links child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map` that contains Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. If sub-issues are unavailable, add it to a task list in the map and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub issue dependencies. If unavailable, put `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the child body.
- **Frontier query**: find the first open, unassigned child without an open blocker.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child issue, and append a context link to the map's Decisions-so-far section.
